Event Photography and Videography Booking System - University OOP Project | SLIIT | Java Â· JSP Â· Servlets


This system was developed as a university group project for the Object-Oriented Programming (SE1020) module at SLIIT. It provides a complete end-to-end solution for managing media professional bookings, including photographers, videographers, and dronographers.

ðŸ”¹ Users can register, log in, rate service providers, and make bookings.
ðŸ”¹ Admins have full access to manage users, media professionals, bookings, and event packages.
ðŸ”¹ The platform uses file handling (no databases) for data storage and is fully built with Java, JSP, and Servlet technologies.

âœ… Applied OOP Concepts:

Encapsulation: All data classes use private fields with public getters/setters.

Abstraction: Manager classes encapsulate file handling and logic.

Inheritance & Polymorphism: Logical separation and structure using reusable and overridable methods.

Composition: Bookings and ratings are linked to media professionals.

Modularity: Clean separation between model, controller, and view layers.

This project showcases strong Java fundamentals, clean coding structure, and team-based software engineering practices with real-world features and a modern, user-friendly UI.
